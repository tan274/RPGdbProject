# RPG Database Management App  

This was a team project where we built the backend of a role-playing game database and a simple Python GUI to manage it.  
The database was hosted on **Google Cloud SQL (MySQL)** and the GUI was made with **Tkinter** so users could easily add, update, or search for players, characters, and items.

## What it does  
- Store RPG data (players, characters, items) in a cloud-hosted MySQL database  
- GUI supports CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)  
- Extra queries include:  
  - Top 5 players with the most points  
  - Show a character’s stats  
  - Look up an item’s attributes

## My role  
- Set up and migrated the database to Google Cloud SQL  
- Added indexes to speed up queries on large tables  
- Built specialized queries in the GUI  
- Helped coordinate team integration

## Tech stack  
- Python (Tkinter for GUI)  
- MySQL on Google Cloud SQL
